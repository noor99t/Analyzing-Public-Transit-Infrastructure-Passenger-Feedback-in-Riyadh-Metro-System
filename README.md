### 🎯 **Project Objective**

To transform raw spatial and attribute data of Riyadh’s public transportation system into clear, actionable insights through a Power BI dashboard. The focus was on understanding:

* Passenger satisfaction trends.
* Infrastructure types (metro & bus).
* Development progress and accessibility.

---

### 📁 **Tools & Data**

* **Tools Used:** Power BI, Excel
* **Data Sources:** JSON & attribute tables for metro stations and bus stop infrastructure

 Metro Stations – Satisfaction & Structure Analysis**

✅ **What Was Done:**

* Cleaned and standardized 201 metro stations across 6 lines.
* Merged station attributes with 2,451 passenger feedback entries.
* Categorized stations by type (Elevated, Deep Underground, Shallow Underground, At Grade).
* Visualized satisfaction using KPIs, pie charts, and maps.

 🔍 **Key Insights:**

* **Overall Satisfaction:** 4.6 / 5.0
* **Most Common Feedback:**

  * ⭐ Very Satisfied: **73.6%**
  * 👍 Satisfied: **18.4%**
* **Station Types:**

  * Elevated stations dominate: **83%**
  * Deep Underground: **11%**
* **Best-rated type:** Shallow Underground (4.8/5), despite being only 5% of stations.
* **At Grade stations** received the lowest rating: **3.9 / 5.0**

 Bus Stops – Type, Progress & Route Coverage**

### ✅ **What Was Done:**

* Analyzed 3,010 bus stops across 89 routes.
* Classified by shelter type, development stage, and directional coverage.
* Integrated slicers for dynamic filtering by structure and progress.

### 🔍 **Key Insights:**

* **Most Common Structure:**

  * Feeder pole (reduced adaptation): **61.3%**
  * Air-conditioned shelters: **22.5%**
* **Development Progress:**

  * Only **28.2%** reached "beyond Stage 5".
  * **1.1%** are still in planning – major opportunity area.
* **Directional Spread:**

  * Direction 1 (outbound): **78%**
  * Direction 2 (return): **21%**
* **Opportunity:** Optimize infrastructure balance across directions and complete pending shelter developments.

Metro Line Distribution – Number of Stations**

### ✅ **What Was Done:**

* Mapped and counted stations per metro line using cleaned coordinates.
* Filtered to show 6 lines with respective shares of total stations.

### 🔍 **Key Insights:**

* **Line 1** has the highest share: **33.05%** of total stations.
* **Line 5** has the lowest presence: **3.1%**
* **Potential Issue:** One line might have fewer stations in data, possibly under construction or incomplete records.

---

### 📌 **Suggested Actions / Future Extensions**

* Cross-validate missing or low-frequency station records (e.g. Metro Line 5).
* Correlate satisfaction data with **location**, **station type**, and **line** to prioritize improvements.
* Add temporal filters if timestamped data becomes available to study satisfaction over time.

### 🔗 **Final Notes**

This dashboard helps transport authorities and city planners:

* Spot infrastructure imbalances.
* Understand rider preferences.
* Prioritize enhancements to stations and shelters.
