## 🚌🚇 Riyadh Public Transport Dashboard – Project Summary

This project explores and visualizes key insights from **Riyadh’s public transportation system**, focusing on both **metro stations** and **bus stop infrastructure**. The goal is to identify patterns in **user satisfaction**, **infrastructure types**, and **development progress** using interactive visuals and clean data modeling in **Power BI**.

---

### 📍 Metro Stations – Satisfaction & Structure

The first part of the dashboard analyzes **passenger feedback on metro stations** across the city.
We collected **2,451 responses** linked to **201 metro stations**, and analyzed them across two main dimensions:

* **Satisfaction Category**
* **Station Type**

#### 🔑 Key Insights:

* Average satisfaction score: **4.6 / 5.0**
* Most users were:

  * **Very Satisfied** → 70%
  * **Satisfied** → 22%
  * Only a small percentage were **Neutral** (4.5%) or **Poor** (3.5%)

#### 🏗️ Station Structure:

* **Elevated stations** were the most common: **83%**
* **Deep underground**: 11%
* **Shallow underground**: 5%
* **At-grade stations** were the least common: 1%

alot of  slicers to  allow users to filter by:

* **Station Type**
* **Satisfaction Category**
*  Metro Line number
*  Sheter Type

### 🚌 Bus Stop Infrastructure – Type, Progress, and Routes

The second part focuses on the infrastructure of **bus stops** in Riyadh:

* **3,010 bus stops** analyzed across **89 bus lines**
* Average: **33.82 stops per line**

#### 🏗️ Bus Stop Type:

* **Feeder poles (reduced site adaptation)** were most common: 61.3%
* **Air-conditioned shelters**: 22.5%
* Other types include open shelters, BRT stations, and rare structures like terminals and iconic stations

#### 🔄 Development Progress:

* Most stops are in advanced stages:

  * **Beyond Stage 5**: 28.2%
  * **Stage 1 & 2**: \~39% combined
* Only **1.1%** are still in planning

#### ➡️ Route Direction:

* **Direction 1** (main routes): 78.2%
* **Direction 2**: 20.7%

Two slicers allow dynamic filtering by:

* **Bus Stop Type**
* **Development Stage**

### 🧰 Tools Used:

* **Power BI** (Data modeling, visuals)
* **Excel** (Initial cleaning & transformation)
* **Data Sources:** JSON files and attribute tables from Riyadh’s official transport dataset
